saulhudson-color-schemes
========================

A selection of Sublime Text 2 color schemes which are loosely based on other work in the community.

### Citizen Kane

Originated as a clone of Tomorrow Night and Zenburn. Essentially this is slightly higher constrast than zenburn but keeping some of the pastel style colors which make it so pleasing on the eye. I hope this is a very modern look but yet provides perfect coloring to still easily spot the variables, strings, brackets, seperators and keywords in your code. This has been created with PHP, HTML, CSS and JS in mind but I'll gladly help make it better for other languages as well.

### Citizen Bane

A lighter version of Citizen Kane for perfect coding in the evening or times when natural light is at a minimum.

### Install

Simply search package control for "saulhudson". I also recommend using Soda Dark Theme to 'skin' Sublime Text.
